# elm-anima

Anima is an attempt at an animation framework entirely in Elm and intended to
be used with the [Elm architecture][elmarch].  This library is the product of
an experiment to arrive at an architecture using types and the algebra around
them as [functional thinking][ft] tools. Anima encompasses normal "fixed"
animations, retargetable/additive animations as well as physics-based
animations.  The core library is about 500 lines of Elm code and includes an
opinionated notion of application architecture that's an elaboration of the
[Elm architecture][elmarch].
